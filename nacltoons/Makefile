#
# Default configuration
#
# By default we will build a Debug configuration using the GCC newlib toolcahin
# to override this, specify TOOLCHAIN=newlib|glibc or CONFIG=Debug|Release on
# the make command-line or in this file prior to including common.mk.  The
# toolchain we use by default will be the first valid one listed
VALID_TOOLCHAINS:=newlib glibc


#
# Get pepper directory for toolchain and includes.
#
# If NACL_SDK_ROOT is not set, then assume it can be found relative to
# to this Makefile.

# List of libraries to link against.  Unlike some tools, the GCC and LLVM
# based tools require libraries to be specified in the correct order.  The
# order should be symbol reference followed by symbol definition, with direct
# sources to the link (object files) are left most.  In this case:
#    hello_world -> ppapi_main -> ppapi_cpp -> ppapi -> pthread -> libc
# Notice that libc is implied and come last through standard compiler/link
# switches.
#
# We break this list down into two parts, the set we need to rebuild (DEPS)
# and the set we do not. This  example does not have any additional library
# dependencies.
