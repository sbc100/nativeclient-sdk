This folder contains code for binding various C/C++ compontents
to Lua.  The bindings were created using tolua++ and the build
script from cocos2dx (tools/tolua++/build.php).

All the sources and headers in this folder are auto-generated.

The box2d bindings were taking from the cocos2dx forum here:
http://www.cocos2d-x.org/boards/11/topics/3181

The hope is that both the box2d and the cocos2dx extension bindings
will get including in cocos2dx upstream in the near future.
