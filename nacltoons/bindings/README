This folder contains code for binding various C/C++ compontents
to Lua.  The bindings are generated using tolua++.

Sources and headers in this folder are all auto-generated.

The box2d bindings were taking from the cocos2dx forum here:
http://www.cocos2d-x.org/boards/11/topics/3181

To rebuild the bindings run 'make' in this folder.
