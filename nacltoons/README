NaClToons
=========

NaClToons is fully fledged example for use with the NaCl SDK.  The
plan is to have it be both a game engine and a game creation
toolkit.

NaClToons is based on Cocos2D-X and used Box2D for physics and Lua
for game logic.

This is still very much a work in progress.  Currently it is only
know to build on linux.  The top level Makefile should build
everything and includes 'make run' target to run the app.  It is
also possible to build it as a standalone linux application by using
the Makefile in the proj.linux folder.
