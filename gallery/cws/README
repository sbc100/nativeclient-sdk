These are directions for how to upload the necessary .zip file for placing
the Native Client gallery into the Chrome Web Store as a *hosted* app.

1. Increment the version number in manifest.json as appropriate. In order
   to upload to the CWS, the version number must increase with each new
   uploaded .zip file.

2. Run ./cws_package.sh. This will create nacl-gallery-app.zip.

3. Go to the developer dashboard at 
   https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard, and click edit on
   the app.

4. Upload nacl-gallery-app.zip.



All of the app images are in the images directory.  They are used as follows:

NaCl16.png: "16" image used by the manifest for the small icon in the CWS
NaCl128.png: "128" image used by the manifest for the app icon in Chrome
NaCl_128_128.png: icon used in the CWS (upload on the edit page)
NaCl_400_275.png: screenshot for the app (upload on the edit page)

NaCl16.png and NaCl128.png must be included in the zip file uploaded to the CWS
