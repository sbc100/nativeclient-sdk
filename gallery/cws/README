These are directions for how to upload the necessary .zip file for placing
the Native Client gallery into the Chrome Web Store as a *hosted* app.

1. Increment the version number in manifest.json as appropriate. In order
   to upload to the CWS, the version number must increase with each new
   uploaded .zip file.

2. Run ./cws_package.sh. This will create nacl-gallery-app.zip.

3. Go to the developer dashboard at 
   https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard, and click edit on
   the app.

4. Upload nacl-gallery-app.zip.
