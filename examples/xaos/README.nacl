Experimental Native Client XaoS Demo

* Builds on Linux, requiring standard tools such as make, autotools,
  and wget
* Runs in the browser on Linux, Mac, and Windows

This is an experimental version of XaoS for Native Client. XaoS
is open-source and depends on GSL, which is also open source.
For more information see:

  http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
  http://xaos.sourceforge.net/index.php

GSL is now included as part of the Native Client packages.  If you
haven't already done so, you can install these packages for Native Client
with a provided script.  Please see:

  .../native_client_sdk/packages/README.txt

Once you have the packages installed, you will be able to build and
run Xaos with:

  ./xaos_tool.sh all

and follow the instructions printed at the end.
