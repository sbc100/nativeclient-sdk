KNOWN ISSUES

- [All, Develop]: To debug your .nexe you have to build a special version.  Once
  you have a development version of your module, you can run Google Chrome in
  your favorite debugger (e.g. gdb); in addition to the list of flags above, you
  can add --load-plugin=/path/to/my/plugin (see above).

- [Linux]: Only 32-bit browsers can load .nexes. 64-bit doesn't work yet.

TROUBLESHOOTING

- [Mac]: If you see "Missing Plug-in", check that the symlinks in
  ~/Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins are correct.  If you need to fix them, you will
  have to quit and restart the browser.  Make sure you started the browser with
  the --internal-pepper flag in addition to the --enable-nacl flag.
