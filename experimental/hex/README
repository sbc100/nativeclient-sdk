This directory contains Html, Javascript, and C++ files to implement the Hex
Game (with AI) as a NativeClient application.

The hex_12.cpp file is NOT part of the build.  This is the original
AI/application that Cameron Browne posted on the web along with articles on the
game of Hex.  It is provided here as a reference point for hex_maniac.cc.
hex_manaic.cc is a copy of hex_12.cpp but with the changes necessary to be a
NativeClient application.

Key changes include:
  - Not using stdin for input, but instead waiting for events to be sent from
    the browser.
  - Not having a main(), but instead having AppMain which is run as a separate
    thread from the main thread that handles messages from the browser and sends
    (posts) messages back.  The main thread/Native Client instance is defined in
    hex_instance.h and hex_instance.cc.
  - The output is still there.  This is useful in debugging on Linux, because
    if you launch chrome from a terminal, then the text version of the game
    state will be printed to the terminal, as well as other printf/cout
    messages.
