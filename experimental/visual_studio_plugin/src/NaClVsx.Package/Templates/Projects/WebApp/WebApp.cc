/// @file $safeprojectname$.cc
/// This example demonstrates loading, running and scripting a very simple NaCl
/// module.  To load the NaCl module, the browser first looks for the
/// CreateModule() factory method (at the end of this file).  It calls
/// CreateModule() once to load the module code from your .nexe.  After the
/// .nexe code is loaded, CreateModule() is not called again.
///
/// Once the .nexe code is loaded, the browser than calls the CreateInstance()
/// method on the object returned by CreateModule().  It calls CreateInstance()
/// each time it encounters an <embed> tag that references your NaCl module.
///
/// The browser can talk to your NaCl module via the postMessage() Javascript
/// function.  When you call postMessage() on your NaCl module from the browser,
/// this becomes a call to the HandleMessage() method of your pp::Instance
/// subclass.  You can send messages back to the browser by calling the
/// PostMessage() method on your pp::Instance.  Note that these two methods
/// (postMessage() in Javascript and PostMessage() in C++) are asynchronous.
/// This means they return immediately - there is no waiting for the message
/// to be handled.  This has implications in your program design, particularly
/// when mutating property values that are exposed to both the browser and the
/// NaCl module.
