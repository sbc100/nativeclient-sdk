     * dwarf.h: Add GNU template defines.
     * libdwarf.h: Add new error code DW_DLE_NOT_REF_FORM for
       the DWARF 4 case where DW_FORM_data4/8 no longer
       valid global reference forms.
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: Document the manner that DW_OP_implicit_value
       is returned as a location description set.
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerate. Rev 1.89.
     * dwarf_error.c: Add two new DW_DLE error strings.
     * dwarf_frame.h: define DW_DEBUG_FRAME_VERSION4 for
       DWARF4 support. Add address size and segment size fields
       to the internal CIE structure.
     * dwarf_query.c: The form-class code was not correct,
       DWARF4 has DW_FORM_sec_offset, not DWARF3.
       Some places did not use the CU context address size
       when reading an address.
     * dwarf_form.c: Use the CU-context address size
       instead of the overall object address/offset size.
       Initialize all local variables at the point of declaration.
       Refine some commentary.
       Use the CU version number to guide processing of some FORMs.
     * dwarf_print_lines.c, dwarf_query.c: Use the CU-context 
       address size instead of the overall object address/offset size.
       Handle DW_LNE user extensions as well as possible.
     * dwarf_arange.c: Delete some erroneous code (already ifdefd out)
       as the address size need not match the de_pointer_size.
       If segment-selector non-zero, read it properly.
       DWARF2 and DWARF3 left this documented in an incorrect
       and unusable fashion (DWARF4 documents it properly).
     * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Delete erroneous code (previously ifdefd out)
       as the address size need not match the de_pointer_size.
     * dwarf_sort_line.c, dwarf_line.c: Deal with DW_DLE extended 
       line operations past those defined by the standard 
       (such as user-defined operations).
     * dwarf_line.h: For user-defined line extended operations, provide
       a sanity check of DW_LNE_LEN_MAX.
     * dwarf_base_types.h: Add DW_CIE_VERSION4 for DWARF4.
       Add other defines so each defined version number (sections
       differ) has a name for the relevant section.
     * dwarf_frame2.c: Add address size to argument lists so the proper
       CIE address size (a new field in DWARF4 CIEs) are honored.
       Also read the new DWARF4 segment_size field.
       Use the address size instead of the object-derived de_pointer_size.
     * dwarf_util.c: Return address_size instead of de_pointer_size.
     * dwarf_loc.c: DWARF4 uses DW_FORM_sec_offset, not
       DW_FORM_data4 or DW_FORM_data8 when specifying offsets to
       other sections.  Add DWARF4 DW_OP_implicit_value and
       DW_OP_stack_value.
     * dwarf_frame.c: Initialize a local variable  at the point
       of declaration.

     * libdwarf2.1.mm: Fix a spelling error.
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: Regenerate. Rev 1.88.
2010-02-01  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf_frame.c: The DW_CFA_remember_state and DW_CFA_restore_state
       operations were not recording/restoring the cfa_rule, now they do.
2010-01-27  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf_form.c: form_refsig8() had an uninitialized
       local variable.
2010-01-25  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf2.1.mm:  Rev 1.87.  Improved the discussion
       of frame information.
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: regenerated.
2010-01-25  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * pro_opaque.h, pro_init.c, pro_section.c,
       pro_reloc_stream.c, pro_reloc_symbolic.c: Rename the function
       pointer members de_func and de_func_b to 
       de_callback_func and de_callback_func_b respectively.
2010-01-17  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf.h, libdwarf.h: Updated commentary about frame interfaces.
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: New descriptions of DW_FRAME_CFA_COL
       and DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3.   Document rev 1.86 .
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated.
     * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Fixed a couple of typos. Rev 1.28.
     * libdwarf2p.1.pdf: Regenerated.
     * configure.in: Added support for configure
       --enable-oldframcol.
     * config.h.in: Added support for configure
       --enable-oldframcol.
     * dwarf_init_finish.c: Added support for configure
       --enable-oldframecol (see DW_FRAME_CFA_COL and 
       DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3).  By default the frame column
       is now DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3.   --enable-oldframecol
       changes the default to DW_FRAME_CFA_COL.
     * configure: Regenerated.
     * dwarf_opaque.h: Added one blank line and deleted
       one, hopefully aiding clarity.
     * dwarf_frame.c: Added commentary about the frame
       interfaces to emphasize the newer ones.
2010-01-13  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf_print_lines.c: Changed 'include files count'
       to 'files count'.
2010-01-04  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * pro_section.c, pro_opaque.h: A pretty-print tool 
       generated some odd formatting (long ago) and there 
       were silly blank lines present as well. This makes things more
       readable.
2010-01-03  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * common.h, common.c: Remove <cr> line end characters.
       Update copyright for 2010.
     * All other files: Update copyright year.
