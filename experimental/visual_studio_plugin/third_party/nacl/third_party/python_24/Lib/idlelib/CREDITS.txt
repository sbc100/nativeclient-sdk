Guido van Rossum, as well as being the creator of the Python language, is the
original creator of IDLE.  Other contributors prior to Version 0.8 include
Mark Hammond, Jeremy Hylton, Tim Peters, and Moshe Zadka.

IDLE's recent development has been carried out in the IDLEfork project.
The objective was to develop a version of IDLE which had an execution
environment which could be initialized prior to each run of user code.

The IDLEfork project was initiated by David Scherer, with some help from Peter
Schneider-Kamp and Nicholas Riley.  David wrote the first version of the RPC
code and designed a fast turn-around environment for VPython.  Guido developed
the RPC code and Remote Debugger currently integrated in IDLE.  Bruce Sherwood
contributed considerable time testing and suggesting improvements.

Besides David and Guido, the main developers who have been active on IDLEfork
are Stephen M. Gava, who implemented the configuration GUI, the new
configuration system, and the About dialog, and Kurt B. Kaiser, who completed
the integration of the RPC and remote debugger, implemented the threaded
subprocess, and made a number of usability enhancements.

Other contributors include Raymond Hettinger, Tony Lownds (Mac integration),
Neal Norwitz (code check and clean-up), and Chui Tey (RPC integration, debugger
integration and persistent breakpoints).

Scott David Daniels, Hernan Foffani, Christos Georgiou, Martin v. Löwis, 
Jason Orendorff, Noam Raphael, Josh Robb, Nigel Rowe, and Bruce Sherwood have
submitted useful patches.  Thanks, guys!
