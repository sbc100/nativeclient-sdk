This directory containes a simple Makefile intended as template for
your own use. It also demonstrates the use of the validator and the
emulator.

A few things to keep in minds when you try your own examples:

* the the native client runtime system does not support many system calls
* when running under the emulator the location of files read by a nacl modules
  is obscured. As a last resort you can run qemu with strace to figure which
  paths are being used.
* to run code on real hardware, just copy the sel_ldr AND the nacl module
  to the device
