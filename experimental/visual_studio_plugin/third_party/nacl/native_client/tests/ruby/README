1. Change current directory to native_client/tests/ruby

cd install_dir/build/native_client/tests/ruby

2. From native_client/tests/ruby directory:

make nacl download

  It will download Ruby sources and will copy neccessary files from
  native_client/tests/ruby/appendix to these sources.

3. Build NaCl ruby from native_client/tests/ruby directory:

make nacl debug

or

make nacl release

4. Run golden tests:

make nacl golden

5. Start a webserver from native_client directory using:

/usr/bin/python2.5 tools/httpd.py

6. Goto http://localhost:5103/tests/ruby/ruby.html and wait until
   "Ruby is loaded" message is appeared. 99% of time it require less
   than a second to load.

7. Try Ruby queries like:

puts "Hello, world!"
name = "Joe"
puts "Hello, #{name}"
puts 2+3
10.times { puts "NaCl\n" }

  Not everything works, you should expect some errors.
