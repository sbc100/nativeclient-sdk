This directory contains a simple "hello world" NaCl NPAPI plugin,
the simplest possible example of NPAPI in C that we know how to build.
See npapi_hw.html for detail on how to use.

To build, use the Makefile as follows:
- make debug nacl
- cp npapi_hw_debug.nexe npapi_hw
Now open npapi_hw.html from this directory in a browser.

Alternatively, build with scons from the native_client directory as follows:
- ./scons MODE=nacl npapi_hw
Now open npapi_hw.html from scons-out/nacl/staging.
