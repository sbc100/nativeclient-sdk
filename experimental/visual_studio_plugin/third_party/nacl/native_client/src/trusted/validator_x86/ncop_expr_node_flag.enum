# Defines that a use occurs for this subexpression.
ExprUsed
# Defines that an address is computed by the subexpression.
ExprAddress
# Defines that the subexpression corresponds to the destination
# of the corresponding instruction.
ExprDest
# Defines that the size of the data is 1 byte.
ExprSize8
# Defines that the size of the data is 2 bytes.
ExprSize16
# Defines that the size of the data is 4 bytes.
ExprSize32
# Defines that the size of the data is 8 bytes.
ExprSize64
# Defines that the constant is an unsigned hex value instead of an integer.
ExprUnsignedHex
# Defines that the constant is a signed hexidecimal value instead of
# an integer.
ExprSignedHex
# Defines that the constant is an unsigned integer instead of a hex value.
ExprUnsignedInt
# Defines that the constant is a signed integer instead of a hex value.
ExprSignedInt
# Defines an implicit argument that shouldn't be printed.
