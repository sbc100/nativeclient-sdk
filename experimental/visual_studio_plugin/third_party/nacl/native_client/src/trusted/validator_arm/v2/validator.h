 *   code_region_bytes: number of bytes in the code region, starting at address
 *       0 and including the trampolines, etc.  Must be a power of two.
 *   data_region_bits: number of bytes in the data region, starting at address
 *       0 and including the code region.  Must be a power of two.
 *   read_only_registers: registers that untrusted code must not alter (but may
 *       read).  This currently applies to r9, where we store some thread state.
 *   data_address_registers: registers that must contain a valid data-region
 *       address at all times.  This currently applies to the stack pointer, but
 *       could be extended to include a frame pointer for C-like languages.
 *
 * The values of these inputs will typically be taken from the headers of
 * untrusted code -- either by the ABI version they indicate, or (perhaps in
 * the future) explicit indicators of what SFI model they follow.
