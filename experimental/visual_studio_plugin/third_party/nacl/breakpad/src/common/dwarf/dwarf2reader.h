// The base of DWARF2/3 debug info is a DIE (Debugging Information

// DWARF groups DIE's into a tree and calls the root of this tree a
// "compilation unit".  Most of the time, their is one compilation
// unit in the .debug_info section for each file that had debug info
// generated.
// Each DIE consists of

// 1. a tag specifying a thing that is being described (ie
// DW_TAG_subprogram for functions, DW_TAG_variable for variables, etc
// 2. attributes (such as DW_AT_location for location in memory,
// DW_AT_name for name), and data for each attribute.
// 3. A flag saying whether the DIE has children or not

// In order to gain some amount of compression, the format of
// each DIE (tag name, attributes and data forms for the attributes)
// are stored in a separate table called the "abbreviation table".
// This is done because a large number of DIEs have the exact same tag
// and list of attributes, but different data for those attributes.
// As a result, the .debug_info section is just a stream of data, and
// requires reading of the .debug_abbrev section to say what the data
// means.

// As a warning to the user, it should be noted that the reason for
// using absolute offsets from the beginning of .debug_info is that
// DWARF2/3 support referencing DIE's from other DIE's by their offset
// from either the current compilation unit start, *or* the beginning
// of the .debug_info section.  This means it is possible to reference
// a DIE in one compilation unit from a DIE in another compilation
// unit.  This style of reference is usually used to eliminate
// duplicated information that occurs across compilation
// units, such as base types, etc.  GCC 3.4+ support this with
// -feliminate-dwarf2-dups.  Other toolchains will sometimes do
// duplicate elimination in the linker.
